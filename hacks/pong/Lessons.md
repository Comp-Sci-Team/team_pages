### **Lessons On JavaScript**

### Lessons: 💻 Mathmatical Expresions

📌 What Is a Mathematical Expression in Code?
In programming, a mathematical expression is a line of code that calculates a value using numbers, variables, and operators—just like in math class!
Example:
let result = 5 + 3 * 2;


This calculates 5 + (3 × 2) and stores the result in result.

🧩 Key Operators in JavaScript
|  |  |  |  | 
| + |  | 4 + 2 | 6 | 
| - |  | 7 - 3 | 4 | 
| * |  | 5 * 2 | 10 | 
| / |  | 8 / 4 | 2 | 
| % |  | 9 % 4 | 1 | 
| ** |  | 2 ** 3 | 8 | 



🧠 Variables in Expressions
You can use variables to store values and build expressions:
let x = 10;
let y = 3;
let total = x + y * 2; // total = 10 + (3 × 2) = 16



🔍 Order of Operations
Just like in math, JavaScript follows PEMDAS:
- Parentheses
- Exponents
- M/D Multiplication/Division (left to right)
- A/S Addition/Subtraction (left to right)
let result = (4 + 2) * 3; // = 6 × 3 = 18



🧪 Practice Challenge
Try writing this in JavaScript:
let a = 5;
let b = 2;
let c = 3;
let expression = a * b + c ** 2 - (a + c);
console.log(expression);


Can you predict the output before running it?

Would you like to turn this into an interactive quiz, a mini project, or a game-like challenge next? I can also show how expressions work in Python or C++ if you're exploring other languages!
