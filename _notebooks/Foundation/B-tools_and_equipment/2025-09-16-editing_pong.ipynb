    "# Modifications in Pong\n",
    "\n",
    "## UI\n",
    "\n",
    "The first edit we made to pong was the UI. Compared to the original, in which the score is on the game, we added a scoreboard to keep track of score. We did this using functions such as the code below, which would update the scoreboard to match what the left side and right side have.\n",
    "\n",
    "```bash\n",
    "function updateScoreboard(){\n",
    "  scoreboard.textContent = `${leftScore} : ${rightScore}`;\n",
    "}\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "We also added more options such as the start button:\n",
    "\n",
    "```bash\n",
    "document.getElementById('start').onclick = () => {\n",
    "  if (!running) {\n",
    "    running = true;\n",
    "    requestAnimationFrame(gameLoop);\n",

    "\n",
    "```bash\n",
    "document.getElementById('reset').onclick = resetGame;\n",

    "document.getElementById('mode').onclick = () => {\n",
    "  modeAI = !modeAI;\n",

    "## Bullets\n",
    "\n",
    "The special feature that we added was bullets. This made it so that you could shoot a bullet, that, if it made contact with the enemy player, it would freeze them for some time.\n",
